In this program, a math function was implemented with the capability of 
being able to perform the following mathematical, logical and shift operations
for two values referred to as "num1" and "num2". These operations are:

Addition: (num1 + num2)
Subtraction: (num1 - num2)
Multiplication: (num1 * num2)
Division: (num1 / num2)
Modulus: (num1 % num2)
Shift Left: (num1 << num2)
Shift Right: (num1 >> num2)
Bitwise AND: (num1 & num2)
Bitwise OR: (num1 | num2)
Bitwise XOR: (num1 ^ num2)
Bitwise NOT: (~num1)
